tpch playground in Oracle
step by step guide for setting up tpc-h schema in oracle VM 

1. Download tpc-h tools from here: http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/current_specifications5.asp
2. put it on your linux and unzip
3. Build dbgen:
	-> $ cp makefile.suite makefile # copying makefile template 
	-> $ nano makefile # some fields have to be updated 
		now update makefile: 
		find CHANGE NAME OF ANSI COMPILER HERE  section and update:
			CC = gcc
			DATABASE = ORACLE
			MACHINE = LINUX
			WORKLOAD = TPCH 
		save and exit nano 
	-> $ make # build dbgen 
4. use dbgen to download datasets, for example 4GB in 2 chunks:
	$ ./dbgen -s 4 -S 1 -C 2 -v
	$ ./dbgen -s 4 -S 2 -C 2 -v
5. check if indeed you have ~4gb of data:
	$ du -ch *.tbl* | grep total 

6. run sql utility:
	ssh oracle@localhost -p 2200 # my conn. to oracle dev. vm
	cd /u01/userhome/bin
	sql
	login as system / oracle 
8. do following:
	create tablespace tpch_ts2 datafile 'tpch_ts2.dbf'  size 100m autoextend on next 100m nologging;
	create user tpch2 identified by tpch2 temporary tablespace temp default tablespace tpch_ts2 ;
	grant connect,resource to tpch2;
	grant create any directory to tpch2;
	conn tpch2/tpch2
	create directory tpch_dir2 as '/u01/userhome/oracle/mytpch/2.18.0_rc2/dbgen';
	
10. execute tpch_create_tables.sql
	 to run .sql scripts through sql utility following syntax applies:  
	 	@/path_to_your_sql_file/file.sql

11. check if all tables were created with 
	SELECT OBJECT_NAME FROM ALL_OBJECTS WHERE OBJECT_TYPE='TABLE' AND OWNER='TPCH';
	check your username if you need to with 
		SELECT USER FROM DUAL; 
12. check counts of tables:
13.execute below scripts:
	persistent_objects_tpch.sql
	load_data.sql
	build_constraints_tpch.sql
	to load data you might need to execute GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO tpch2; as a system user 
14. you might want to rename tables like that:
	RENAME TABLE H_LINEITEM TO LINEITEM;
